Higher-Order Company: Towards an Optimal Computer
=================================================

## What is the true nature of computation?

A hundred years ago, humanity answered that very question, twice. In 1936, Alan
invented the Turing Machine, which, highly inspired by the mechanical trend of
the 20th century, distillated the common components of early computers into a
single universal machine that, despite its simplicity, was capable of performing
every computation conceivable.  From simple numerical calculations to entire
operating systems, this small machine could compute anything. Thanks to its
elegance and simplicity, the Turing Machine became the most popular model of
computation, and served as the main inspiration behind every modern processor
and programming language. C, Fortran, Java, Python are languages based on a
procedural mindset, which is highly inspired by Turing's invention.

Yet, the Turing Machine wasn't the only model of computation that humanity
invented. Albeit less known, also in 1936, and in a completely independent way,
Alonzo Church invented the Lambda Calculus, which distillated the common
components - not of machines, but of different branches of math - into a single
universal language that was capable of modeling every mathematical theory. What
was surprising, though, is that this language, unexpectedly, could also perform
universal computations. The same algorithms that could be computed by Turing
Machines procedurally, could also be computed by the Lambda Calculus, through
symbolic manipulations. The idea of using the Lambda Calculus for computing
inspired the creation of an entire new branch of programming, now known as the
functional paradigm. Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, Agda are languages based on that
mindset, which is highly inspired by Church's invention - or discovery.

## Beyond Turing Completeness

If both Turing Machines (and procedural languages), and the Lambda Calculus (and
functional languages), are capable of computation, which mindset is the "right
one"? When it comes to raw capabilities, neither. Still on the 20th century, it
was proven that, when it comes to computability, Turing Machines and the Lambda
Calculus are equivalent. Every problem that one can solve, can also be solved by
the other. That insight is known as the Church-Turing thesis, which essentially
states that computers are capable of emulating each-other. If that was
completely true, then the choice wouldn't matter. After all, if, for example,
every programming language is capable of solving the same set of problems, then
what is the point in making a choice?

Yet, while the Church-Turing hypothesis makes a statement about *computability*,
it says nothing about *computation*. In other words, **a model can be inherently
less efficient than other**. Historically, procedural languages such as C and
Fortran have have consistently outperformed the fastest functional languages,
such as Haskell and Ocaml. Yet, languages like Haskell and Agda provide
abstractions that make entire classes of bugs unrepresentable. Historically, the
functional paradigm has been more secure. Of course, these factors can vary
greatly, but the point is that Turing's notion of equivalence is limited.

In 1983, Stephen Wolfram introduced the Rule 110, an elementary cellular
automaton that has been shown to be as capable as both. Wolfram argues that this
model is of fundamental importance for math and physics, and that a new kind of
science should emerge from its study. These claims were met with harsh
scepticism; after all, if all models are equivalent, what is the point? Yet,
we've just stablished that, while equal in capacity, different models result in
different practical outcomes. Perhaps there isn't a new branch of science to
emerge from the study of alternative models of computation, but what about the
design of processors and programming languages?

## Models influence how we think, create and design

A model of computation has a significant impact on the way we design our
languages, and several of their drawbacks can be traced down to limitations of
the underlying model. For example, the parallel primitives of the procedural
paradigm, mutexes and atomics, provide a contrived, complex solution to
multi-threaded synchronization. As a result, parallelism is generally considered
hard, and programmers still write sequential code by default. Similarly,
security isn't natural to the procedural paradigm. Global state, mutable arrays
and loops generate an explosion of possible execution paths, edge cases and
off-by-one errors that make absolute security all but impossible. Even highly
audited code, such as OpenSSL, is often compromised by out-of-bounds exploits.
The functional paradigm handles both issues much better: there is an enourmous
amount of inherent parallelism on functional programs, and, as mentioned,
logic-based type systems make entire classes of bugs unrepresentable. But if
that is the case, then why functional programs are still mostly single-threaded,
and bug-ridden? And why isn't the functional paradigm more prevalent?

A strong factor, we argue, is performance. As much as the Turing Machine, and,
thus, the procedural paradigm as a whole, is inadequate for parallelism and
security, the Lambda Calculus, and the functional paradigm as a whole, is
inadequate for efficient computations. The fundamental operation of the Lambda
Calculus, substitution, may trigger an unbounded amount of copies of an
unboundedly large argument. Because of that, it can not be performed in a
bounded amount of steps, and, thus, there isn't a physical mapping of
substitution to real-world physical processes. In other words, substitution
isn't an atomic operation, which prevents us from creating efficient functional
processors and runtimes. Attempts to solve the issue only pushed it into other
directions, such as the need of shared references, which inhibit parallelism, or
garbage collection, which isn't atomic. The failure of the functional paradigm
to achieve satisfactory efficiency impacted its popularity, which, in turn, lead
to tools like formal proofs to never catch up.

## A perfect Model of Computation

This raises the question: is there a model of computation which, like Turing
Machine, has a reasonable physical implementation, yet, like the Lambda
Calculus, has a robust logical interpretation? In 1997, Yves Lafont proposed a
new alternative, the Interaction Combinators, on which substitution is broken
down into 2 fundamental laws: commutation, which creates and copies information,
and annihilation, which observes and destroys information. In a sense, this may
resemble SKI combinators, but that isn't a good analogy, since SKI combinators
still include non-atomic operations: K may erase an unboundedly large structure,
and S may copy an unboundedly large structure. The charm, and elegance, of the
Interaction Combinators is that its reduction laws are truly atomic: each
operation can be completed in a constant amount of steps, and has a clear
physical mapping. Not only that, they're inherently parallel, in the same sense
that the Lambda Calculus has been claimed to be, in theory, but without the
issues that let it to be, in practice.

Interestingly, every aspect which is considered good in other models of
computation is present on Interaction Combinators, while negative aspects are
almost entirely absent. Moreover, both the Lambda Calculus and the Turing
Machine can be efficiently emulated by the Interaction Combinators, while the
opposite isn't true. This suggests that, while the 3 systems are equivalent in
terms of computability, the Interaction Combinators are more capable in terms of
computation. Under certain point of view, one could argue that both the Turing
Machine and the Lambda Calculus are slight distortions of this fundamental
model, caused by human creativity, due to our historical intuitions regarding
machines and mathematics. Perhaps machines and substitutions aren't as
fundamental as we think, and some alien civilization has developed all its
mathematical theories and computers based on annihilation and commutation, with
no references to the Lambda Calculus, or the Turing Machine. 

## From Interaction Combinators, towards a new era of computing

We, at the Higher-Order Company, hold the view that Interaction Combinators are
a more fundamental model of computation, and, consequently, that computers,
processors and programming languages inspired by them would offer tangible
benefits compared to the ones we built based on Turing Machines and the Lambda
Calculus. The Higher-Order Company was created to research this new model of
computation, and, through the different mindset it brings, catch insights that
will let us produce groundbreaking technology that will push humanity towards
the next level of computational maturity.
